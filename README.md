# hello-world

Hi everyone!
My name is Vania, and I dream of being a Consultant, passionate about solving problems with technology. 

The growing trend of integration between computers and traditional business processes fascinates me and I look forward to contributing towards its development. I also want to find out about using technology to improve trade and relations between global parties. 

Other areas of interest for me include applied computer science, security, disruption technologies, and artificial intelligence.
